    <br>
    <p>I am reworking my website from scratch at the moment. Sorry for the mess, or lack there of.</p>
    <p>You can find me on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/zen.gay">Bluesky</a>, but other than that I have no social media presence.</p>
    <p>The code for this website and other projects I am working on are found on my <a href="https://github.com/ZenIsBestWolf">GitHub</a>.</p>
    <p>You can message me on Discord (@zen.gay) or via email at <a href="mailto:me@zen.gay">me@zen.gay</a>.</p>
    <p>You can find the old version of my website <a href="old">here</a>, as it technically has more content.</p>

    <h2>Education</h2>
    <p>You can find all of my code related to my time in university at <a href="https://github.com/ZenIsBestWolf/cs">this</a> repository.</p>
    <p>I'm currently studying Computer Science at <a href="https://wpi.edu/">WPI</a>. I previously studied at <a href="https://umb.edu/">UMass Boston</a> but have since transferred.</p>
    <p>While in High School and at UMass Boston I learned the principles of Computer Science, developing skills with Python and Java.</p>
    <p>At the time of writing I have not completed any courses at WPI, but I am eager to start learning more.</p>
